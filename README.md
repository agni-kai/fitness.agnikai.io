The Ultimate Fitness Framework

## THE GOAL
**Primary**: Fast and Safe weight loss and subsequent athletic weight maintenance.

**Secondary**: muscle loss prevention and increase in strength & agility.

## THE METHOD
TLDR: IM + Keto + Deficit + Strength Training (linked in footer).

You don't need to buy anything.

## DIET 

### GETTING STARTED
Start with Intermitttent Fasting 16/8 protocol.

Work towards 20/4 or even One Meal a Day (OMAD) within 1 to 3 weeks.

Try Fasting for 24 and then 36 hours at the end of weeks 2 & 3.

Start tracking your calorie, protein & carbs intake.

Read nutrition labels and weigh your portions.

I like to keep track of my meals on paper in the following format: 

· Food Name - kCal / Protein g. / Fat g. / Carbs g.

### INTERMITTENT FASTING

Intermittent Fasting (IF) is the Foundation of Agni Kai's diet. 

It's the most effective & easiest part to follow and by itself may lead to calorie intake reduction and weight loss.

It also prepares your body for Ketogenic diet.

20/4 schedule is recommended.

After the first 3 weeks - 24 to 48 hours fasts can be used to speed up weight loss on a weekly / bi-weekly basis.

Fasting Window is Critical and means 0 calories. No cheating.

### CALORIE DEFICIT

There's no other way about it, if you want to lose weight - you have to eat less. 

This diet's goal is to change your eating habits, so you can maintain it forever, without gaining the weight back. 

Use Macro Calculator to learn your caloric needs & don't push yourself more than 40% deficit.

Re-adjust your Macros every 10 pounds.

### KETO

Ketosis is a metabolic process that allows you to use fat as an energy source.

That includes fat you consume with food and your own body fat.

If you got used to high-carb diets (bread, fruit, sugars, grains, cereal) - Keto could be an issue for the first few weeks (Keto Flu).

Use IF & deficit before starting Keto to make it easier. 

Hydrate aggressively & significantly increase your electrolytes consumption.

Transition to 20g Net carbs within 3 weeks, use Peanut Butter, Bread & Whole Milk as the primary source of carbs during this period.

### SUPPLEMENTS

Pre-workout: glutamine, electrolytes, zero-carb pre-workout (contains creatine, caffeine and beta-alanine).

Post-workout: glutamine, creatine, electrolytes.

Simple Creatine Monohydrate works well and doesn't have any carbs in it.

## WORKOUT 

### 50%-75% INTENSITY

It's expected that you're already familiar with basic barbell exercises and have done r/Stronglifts5x5 for at least a month. 

You want to know your 1 Rep Max (1RM) weights, but ideally, you should use your 3 Rep Max as 100% to scale down from.

Remember: it's critical to avoid micro-injuries to keep working out & continue the weight loss.

### DAILY WORKOUTS

Agni Kai's primary goal is weight loss. 

Although muscle growth & pure strength gains are very likely to occur, avoiding losing muscle mass is only a secondary goal. 

By reducing your regular workouts to 50%-75% intensity, you will allow your body to recover faster between the workouts, making daily gym trips not only possible but also more productive.

### WORK OUT FASTED

Working out fasted can be hard at first, but will ultimately lead to increased energy levels and "unstoppable" feeling. 

This is achieved when your body produces catecholamines to convert white fat cells to brown fat cells which are more readily burned.

This speeds up initial weight loss and becomes especially important at 15% body fat and lower.

### FULL BODY COMPOUND EXERCISES

Barbell exercises from r/Stronglifts5x5 engage bigger muscle groups, which works better for strength training & weight loss.

50%-75% intensity reduction should allow working multiple muscle groups in the same workout. Increasing weight loss speed and supporting simpler, daily schedule.

Smith Machine is NOT recommended. 

Overhead Press & Dumbbells Exercises should be done standing unsupported.

Naturally balancing yourself will engage core and legs, force you to use realistic weights and prevent injuries & bad technique. 

### SETS & REPS

50-75% intensity for main sets (3 sets). You want to use the weight that should cause failure within 8-12 reps and do only 6 to 10 reps respectively.

70-80% intensity for strength sets (2 sets). You want to use weights that will cause failure within 6 reps and do 1-2 reps less. 

Remember: avoiding micro-injuries & next day soreness is a key to daily workouts.

Don't get too excited and over-workout when your energy levels start to rise. This easily can kill your next day workout, or make it harder to maintain the diet.

Start with 2 main exercises per day, e.g. Bench Press + Deadlift one day & Overhead Press + Squats the next one.

Scale to 3-4 main barbell exercises during weeks 4 to 6.

Depending on your fitness levels - start with 1 to 3 reps of main reps per exercise.

Scale up to 2 strength sets + 3 main sets per exercise as you see fit/energy levels allow.

Adding callisthenics & additional dumbbell exercises in between main sets is a great way to increase your fitness but should be avoided for the first 3-4 weeks for beginners.

### ADDITIONAL EXERCISES & IN BETWEEN SETS

 If you’re doing pushing/pressing exercises, you should add pulling exercises on the same day.

You can do it between exercises with more intensity, or between sets with less.

Pull-Ups work well in between sets of Overhead Press & Bench Press.

Dips work with Barbell Row & lower intensity Deadlifts. 

For callisthenics - use a single set of 50%-75% reps in between main sets. Or 3x50-100% reps as the main exercise.

Don't forget to listen to yourself to avoid injuries and hydrate & stretch in between sets.

Other dumbbell exercises that work well in supersets and/or as additional exercises: front delt hammer raises, curls, curls to overhead press, bent-over row.

### 20MIN RUN
I like to have 20-30 min run after the workout.

It's pretty much free 200-400 calories burned and also can be used as a good insight into your energy levels.

When fully fat adapted - run should feel effortless, with no liver pain (side stitch) at 50-75% speeds.

Start slow and raise speed every 1-2 minutes, find the speed that allows you to feel "some action", but doesn't require mental effort to stay on.
